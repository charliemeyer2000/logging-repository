# Logging Repository

This repository takes advantage of GitHub webhooks and uses `ngrok` to point a public facing url to my localhost. Any time I commit or perform any action on a repository that has this webhook configured, it edits this `README.md` file and adds a new `h3` to the file with the commit name, repository committed to, and the date. Below the header, a summary of the code (up to 2000 characters) is generated using GPT 3.5 to summarize the changes.
